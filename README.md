# Collision Detection
This is an application that detects collisions between circles I learned to build with Filipe Alves from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/FilipeAlvesdef">Veslasoft</a>.

This is a JavaScript app that uses Babel to translate the code to JS that browsers understand. The graphical part is built using the canvas API. What makes collision detection possible is Mathematics.
